frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is the arcade game clone project for Udacity adjusted by Jason Fukura. It is
a simple game in the style of "Frogger."

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repo or download as a zip file from `https://github.com/jfukura/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game`.
Then open the index.html file in a modern web browser to get going.

## Playing

Use the arrow keys to move your player across the canvas, but avoid the bugs.
If you and a bug collide, you will start over.  Make it all the way to the water
and you win.
